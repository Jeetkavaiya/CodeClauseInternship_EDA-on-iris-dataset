# EDA-on-iris-dataset
## Introduction
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.
<br/>
## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 observations, with each observation representing a flower. Each observation has four features:
<br/>
1. Sepal Length (cm)
<br/>
2. Sepal Width (cm)
<br/>
3. Petal Length (cm)
<br/>
4. Petal Width (cm)
<br/>
The dataset also includes a target variable which specifies the species of each flower. The three species are:
<br/>
- Iris setosa
<br/>
- Iris versicolor
<br/>
- Iris virginica
<br/>
## Requirements
To run the analysis, you need the following Python packages:
<br/>
- Pandas
<br/>
- NumPy
<br/>
- Matplotlib
<br/>
- Seaborn
<br/>
- Scikit-Learn
<br/>
- Jupyter
<br/>

## The EDA process involves several steps:
Loading the Data: Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
<br/>
Data Cleaning: Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
<br/>
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
<br/>
Data Visualization: Create visualizations to understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables.
<br/>
- Histograms
<br/>
- Box plots
<br/>
- Scatter plots
<br/>
- Pair plots
<br/>
- Correlation heatmaps
<br/>
### Key Findings
  Histograms: Show the distribution of each feature.
<br/>
  Scatter Matrix: Displays pairwise relationships between features.
<br/>
  Correlation Heatmap: Highlights correlations between features.
<br/>  
## Conclusion
This EDA provides insights into the Iris dataset and helps understand the relationships between different features. The visualizations and descriptive statistics are useful for further machine learning tasks, such as classification.
